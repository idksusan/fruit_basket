# AAE Programming Exercise

This is a simple application that takes a csv file and returns a graphical representation of the data as well as an analysis of the metrics in a separate text file.

## Dependencies and Usage

This application uses a number of built-in Python modules including: `csv`, `tkinter`, and `sys`.

To run the application:
1. Open command prompt and navigate to the directory where `fruit_basket.py` is located.
2. To pass filename:
* IF FILE IN SAME DIRECTORY: type in `python fruit_basket.py <filename.csv>`
* IF FILE NOT IN SAME DIRECTORY: type in `python fruit_basket.py <FULL PATH of filename.csv>`
3. Upon pressing enter, a window will pop up with a graph representation of the data in the csv. 
4. Press the button labeled "GET METRICS" and a text file will appear in the same directory with the analyzed metrics.
